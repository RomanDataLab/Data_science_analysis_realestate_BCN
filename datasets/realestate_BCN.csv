Acclaimed as a landmark in its own right, Francesc Macià 10 was first built as an office block in the 1960s by the Swiss architect Marc J. Saugey, a contemporary of Le Corbusier. Reimagined by visionary Brazilian architect Marcio Kogan, the building now offers an unparalleled experience in European city living. THE RESIDENCE Home to a set of eight exclusive apartments, Francesc Macia 10 is an oasis of calm that presides over the bustling city below. Each apartment is fitted with floor-to-ceiling windows for panoramic, ever-changing views and is sold shell and core. Residents are encouraged to tailor their homes to reflect their lifestyle and personality, with a level of customization – from the types of materials to the flow of space – is infinite. Architect Marcio Kogan and his studio have prepared fit-outs for bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchens and living areas which the resident can contract for an additional cost. THE MATERIALS Chosen with solidity and longevity in mind, the materials used at Francesc Macià 10 express the uniqueness of the project. Luxury materials have all been handpicked within a refined spectrum of yellows and greys, and rich American walnut wood has been used to balance the palette. High-quality wood braces the walls, turning former working spaces into comforting homes through its warmth and familiar Barcelona design character. And the world’s finest historical materials, such as Statuario and Carrara marble, are employed to bring a sense of timeless strength and gravitas to the interior. THE SERVICES When creating Francesc Macià 10, all things were considered to ensure a unique living ex- perience. Arriving at Francesc Macià 10 will feel like coming home.

Living in the neighbourhood of Diagonal Mar near the beach was the best decision we made. Not only we could enjoy a peaceful lifestyle as being away from the bustling city centre but also we could reach any point of Barcelona by bike or public transport. When we first visit the apartment we were particularly amazed by the space it is offering. The organisation of the space has been thoroughly designed for every square meter to be used and as being on two levels, the sensation of ample size is real. The massive double-glazed windows that produce a glass wall enable a lot of natural light to flood the penthouse and to emphasize its grandeur. It works as an almost invisible border between the huge living room and the terrace. The latter is one of the highlights of this property and works as an extension of the living room. Surrounded by a wooden deck, the swimming pool-jacuzzi is a luxury feature that adds a special touch. From there, you can enjoy impressive views that are not for faint-hearted. Located on the 25th floor we had a magnificent panorama of the city of Barcelona and Mediterranean Sea within sight. With its three bedrooms, it was perfect for us. My partner and I chose the master bedroom on the upper floor as our love nest. Furnished with a large double bed and a massive built-in wardrobe, it also had an en-suite bathroom with a bathtub. Our daughter’s bedroom was located on the same floor and was also double. She had her own bathroom next door. The third bedroom – also double – was on the lower floor and was similar to our but with access to the terrace. It was ideal to host family and friends. There is another bathroom nearby for more convenience. I had to work from every other day and thankfully there is a room that can be used as a home office. It was actually difficult to work there sometimes as every time I lifted my head, I would have views of the seaside, which I wanted to enjoy instead of working. The modern kitchen is completely equipped with first-choice household appliances and has a small dining area. The apartment is at the top of a modern building within an exclusive complex with various facilities and green areas. Ideal as being as active family, we made an intensive use of the swimming pool, the gym and the paddle courts.

Let it be known - there is a bit of a misconception to the effect that Pedralbes is distant or inaccessible; it is not, duly serviced by public transport, said access to a major freeway, and a sort of 'unexpected' closeness via a pedestrian route to the upper neighborhoods of Barcelona. Pedralbes boasts a high concentration of international schools such as the Lycée Français, St. Paul's School, St. Peter's School and Kensington, as well as two of the most exclusive private clubs in the city: the Royal Tennis Club, where the Conde Godo Trophy Tournament is held every year, as well as the Royal Polo Club, where matches are played in different amateur and professional polo divisions.

As a result, the characteristic homes of this neighborhood are spacious apartments with high ceilings, moldings, elaborate flooring and balconies. Many buildings and apartments preserve this original architectural heritage and it is possible to find recently remodeled apartments, penthouses, lofts and even studios, which revive these elements, as well as apartments with a lot of potential to be reformed. This side of L’Eixample is equipped with all kinds of services and stores, as well as educational centers, mainly state-subsidized and private schools.

Of a renowned model urban planning devised by the engineer Ildefons Cerdá, Eixample marks the epicenter of the city from its main streets: The luxurious Passeig de Gràcia, the commercial Rambla de Catalunya and the updated Passeig de Sant Joan, housing the majority of the modernist architectural icons, such as La Sagrada Familia, La Pedrera or La Casa Batlló of the great Antoni Gaudí. It is a large, quiet but exciting  residential area with extremely convenient commercial activity, designed to respect the privacy of the homes. The Catalan modernist architecture so characteristic of stately airs, but with great cosmopolitan touches, extends throughout the neighborhood to the delight of those who wish to live modernism from within, since it is possible to acquire homes within regal estates with valuable original architectural elements, period pieces and even historical and protected. Schools, squares, wadis, parks, stores and restaurants give dynamism to the area that differentiates the Right from the Left, both with wide uniform streets, octagonal islands and wide island interiors that mark the internal distribution of buildings and homes. You will mostly find buildings of strong bricks, floors of generally wide dimensions, medium or high ceilings, with balconies that give to the wide streets or the inner patios of the Cerdá Plan. Keep in mind this living in the Eixample district, if you are looking for a neighborhood where you can have everything within walking distance or very well connected to public transport, both basic and luxury stores, trendy restaurants or even your workplace among the many offices and stores, this could be your neighborhood. If you want to walk among the iconic monuments of the city, with the comfort of equal distance to any other point or neighborhood in the city.

On the left, an office, on the right, a living room-library, all exterior and with different decorative elements of the time. On the same floor, and behind the glass door, we find some stately stairs that take us to the upper floors. In turn, on the ground floor, access to the kitchen and a multipurpose room with access to the garden are located next to the stairs. Going up the stairs we find a mezzanine with a living room with stunning views and lots of light, a bathroom and a bedroom. On the upper floor we find 4 bedrooms and two bathrooms, one of them en suite, all of them with very characteristic modernist decorative elements. From the stairs you can access two terraces, one halfway, behind the floor of the rooms, and finally to the terrace, where impressive views of all of Vallvidrera and Barcelona await us. Hydraulic paving, wall mosaics, glass doors, facade with decorative elements... the whole house is characterized by being full of details and color. It is a spectacular house to restore, a modernist jewel. The Sarrià neighborhood is located in the upper area near the Collserola Natural Park. It was a town of affluent families that was annexed to Barcelona at the beginning of the 20th century and therefore still retains a charm difficult to find in other neighborhood of Barcelona. Its green spaces are some of the largest and impressive places in the city: the Santa Amelia park, the Oreneta park or Collserola park where we find the well-known Carretera de las Aguas, where children, older people, cyclists or marathon runners go for same. In Sarria there are some of the best schools in Barcelona, including Teresianas, San Ignacio and the international Benjamin Franklin and Oak House. It has excellent communication with the different points of the city thanks to the network of buses and railways of the city of Barcelona.

It is located in the Ronda de Sant Pere, 5 minutes from Plaza Urquinaona, Plaza Cataluña and Paseo de Gracia. From the location of the flat you can also quickly access the Barrio Gótico and the Born. With a dimension of 362 square meters, it has a distribution with all the exterior rooms. Apart from the 7 windows that give views of the whole city, the flat has two small terraces and has wide corridors.

The ceilings are more than three meters high in a floor that is on the top floor of the building. The building is a regal estate from the 1930s. The Eixample district is the most emblematic of Barcelona since the nineteenth century. Of a renowned model urban planning devised by the engineer Ildefons Cerdá, Eixample marks the epicenter of the city from its main streets: The luxurious Passeig de Gràcia, the commercial Rambla de Catalunya and the updated Passeig de Sant Joan, housing the majority of the modernist architectural icons, such as La Sagrada Familia, La Pedrera or La Casa Batlló of the great Antoni Gaudí. It is a large, quiet but exciting  residential area with extremely convenient commercial activity, designed to respect the privacy of the homes. The Catalan modernist architecture so characteristic of stately airs, but with great cosmopolitan touches, extends throughout the neighborhood to the delight of those who wish to live modernism from within, since it is possible to acquire homes within regal estates with valuable original architectural elements, period pieces and even historical and protected. Schools, squares, wadis, parks, stores and restaurants give dynamism to the area that differentiates the Right from the Left, both with wide uniform streets, octagonal islands and wide island interiors that mark the internal distribution of buildings and homes. You will mostly find buildings of strong bricks, floors of generally wide dimensions, medium or high ceilings, with balconies that give to the wide streets or the inner patios of the Cerdá Plan. Keep in mind this living in the Eixample district, if you are looking for a neighborhood where you can have everything within walking distance or very well connected to public transport, both basic and luxury stores, trendy restaurants or even your workplace among the many offices and stores, this could be your neighborhood. If you want to walk among the iconic monuments of the city, with the comfort of equal distance to any other point or neighborhood in the city.

Taking into account that it is a corner building, the apartments will offer a very functional distribution in which all spaces are wisely used and will offer several exterior balconies that will allow a lot of natural light and amazing views.

The two penthouses of the building will be of contemporary design and will offer a sensational exterior exposure and outdoor space that allows views of one of the most sought after pedestrian streets in the city; Rambla de Catalunya. The location of this project needs no further introduction, as Rambla de Catalunya is synonymous with prime location in Barcelona and is located in the heart of the ""Golden Square"" that historically made Barcelona world famous for its beautiful and revolutionary Art Nouveau architecture. Right on the doorstep is Paseo de Gracia, Plaza Catalunya and some of the best gastronomy and shopping this magnificent city has to offer. The Eixample district is the most emblematic of Barcelona since the nineteenth century. Of a renowned model urban planning devised by the engineer Ildefons Cerdá, Eixample marks the epicenter of the city from its main streets: The luxurious Passeig de Gràcia, the commercial Rambla de Catalunya and the updated Passeig de Sant Joan, housing the majority of the modernist architectural icons, such as La Sagrada Familia, La Pedrera or La Casa Batlló of the great Antoni Gaudí. It is a large, quiet but exciting  residential area with extremely convenient commercial activity, designed to respect the privacy of the homes. The Catalan modernist architecture so characteristic of stately airs, but with great cosmopolitan touches, extends throughout the neighborhood to the delight of those who wish to live modernism from within, since it is possible to acquire homes within regal estates with valuable original architectural elements, period pieces and even historical and protected. Schools, squares, wadis, parks, stores and restaurants give dynamism to the area that differentiates the Right from the Left, both with wide uniform streets, octagonal islands and wide island interiors that mark the internal distribution of buildings and homes. You will mostly find buildings of strong bricks, floors of generally wide dimensions, medium or high ceilings, with balconies that give to the wide streets or the inner patios of the Cerdá Plan. Keep in mind this living in the Eixample district, if you are looking for a neighborhood where you can have everything within walking distance or very well connected to public transport, both basic and luxury stores, trendy restaurants or even your workplace among the many offices and stores, this could be your neighborhood. If you want to walk among the iconic monuments of the city, with the comfort of equal distance to any other point or neighborhood in the city.

A home in the heart of Barcelona.    The duplex is located on the main artery of the city, Paseo de Gracia. Located in an emblematic building, whose façade belongs to Antoni de Moragas. An exponent of Barcelona's architecture, he was an advocate of the Scandinavian position vis-à-vis the International Style, taking an interest in the planning and structure of the city as a representative of the most expressionist and organic extreme, and, as a creator, constantly transforming craftsmanship into design.    On the other hand, the architect in charge of the remodelling of the building is Mr. Carlos Ferrater. Laureate architect; recognised nationally and internationally, with awards such as the Gold Medal for Merit in Fine Arts, First Prize in the EGHN (European Garden Award 19/20), Mies Van der Rohe Award, L'Escala Seafront selected FAD Awards 2018, Torres Brothers Kitchen Finalist in the FAD premises and National Architecture Award. In addition to carrying out more renowned architectural works including the exclusive Mandarin building, also located in Paseo de Gracia.    This duplex consists of 164 square metres, set in two stages: a modernist interior and a dreamlike exterior. The living room, presided over by an interior space and connected to the terrace, is in vivid brown tones; a room that is both illuminated and solemn at the same time. As can be seen in the graphic documents, the personalist design of the aforementioned architect opted for an open space in the very centre of the dwelling; and that is why the future fortunate owner is empowered to redesign the aforementioned space in order to increase the metres in the second storey.    The terrace, measuring twenty-five metres square, stands out for its tranquillity: integrated into an urban and interior island. It is the definition of an oasis in the heart of the metropolis. To finish off the first space, the kitchen stands out: a warm ambience with designer finishes, with integrated electrical appliances and finishing off in an inescapably prosaic way, the property also consists of a guest toilet, two bathrooms (one of them en suite), three bedrooms, an office, a gallery and a balcony.    Located in a community with 24h surveillance and more than 70 cameras, it is a secure space; with a concierge for all day-to-day needs.

The refurbishment of this beautiful building from 1871 will offer a distribution of four different apartments per floor and two stunning penthouses with private terraces and plenty of outdoor space. Taking into account that it is a corner building, the apartments will offer a very functional distribution in which all spaces are wisely used and will offer several exterior balconies that will allow a lot of natural light and amazing views. All apartments will be between 98 and 130 m2 and will offer 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms plus a fourth typology that will offer a unique and contemporary loft concept with very open spaces and features that stand out from the typical Eixample apartment. The fully equipped and modern kitchen will be open plan with the living area and most of the apartments will enjoy exposed wooden beams on the ceilings which will also give a certain character to the property. The floors will be of waterproof oak laminate parquet and there will be A/C ducts for both hot and cold. The two penthouses of the building will be of contemporary design and will offer a sensational exterior exposure and outdoor space that allows views of one of the most sought after pedestrian streets in the city; Rambla de Catalunya. The location of this project needs no further introduction, as Rambla de Catalunya is synonymous with prime location in Barcelona and is located in the heart of the ""Golden Square"" that historically made Barcelona world famous for its beautiful and revolutionary Art Nouveau architecture. Right on the doorstep is Paseo de Gracia, Plaza Catalunya and some of the best gastronomy and shopping this magnificent city has to offer. The Eixample district is the most emblematic of Barcelona since the nineteenth century. Of a renowned model urban planning devised by the engineer Ildefons Cerdá, Eixample marks the epicenter of the city from its main streets: The luxurious Passeig de Gràcia, the commercial Rambla de Catalunya and the updated Passeig de Sant Joan, housing the majority of the modernist architectural icons, such as La Sagrada Familia, La Pedrera or La Casa Batlló of the great Antoni Gaudí. It is a large, quiet but exciting  residential area with extremely convenient commercial activity, designed to respect the privacy of the homes. The Catalan modernist architecture so characteristic of stately airs, but with great cosmopolitan touches, extends throughout the neighborhood to the delight of those who wish to live modernism from within, since it is possible to acquire homes within regal estates with valuable original architectural elements, period pieces and even historical and protected. Schools, squares, wadis, parks, stores and restaurants give dynamism to the area that differentiates the Right from the Left, both with wide uniform streets, octagonal islands and wide island interiors that mark the internal distribution of buildings and homes. You will mostly find buildings of strong bricks, floors of generally wide dimensions, medium or high ceilings, with balconies that give to the wide streets or the inner patios of the Cerdá Plan. Keep in mind this living in the Eixample district, if you are looking for a neighborhood where you can have everything within walking distance or very well connected to public transport, both basic and luxury stores, trendy restaurants or even your workplace among the many offices and stores, this could be your neighborhood. If you want to walk among the iconic monuments of the city, with the comfort of equal distance to any other point or neighborhood in the city.

The house is at the midpoint between two aesthetic trends: on the one hand, it maintains elements of Catalan modernism, with details present both in common areas of the building and in the ceiling moldings inside the house. On the other hand, it follows a line of Asian aesthetics known as Wabi-Sabi. This is a philosophy originating in Japan that breaks with many of the typical rules of decoration, as it opposes the absolute symmetry, to discard the old and maintain the standards of perfection in every detail. Despite this, in this house no detail is left to chance. According to this style it is necessary to decorate with the essential and with natural elements. In its distribution it flees from the symmetry of minimalism and is committed to let the spaces breathe and offer a sense of freedom within the home. This combination of aesthetic trends, together with the qualities used for the finishes and its privileged location make this house a completely unique element within what the city of Barcelona has to offer. The apartment was completely renovated with the highest qualities of the market; all its components were thought to the smallest detail. Thanks to the fact that it is located on the sixth floor, the apartment is characterized by being extremely quiet, despite being in the heart of Barcelona. At the same time, it enjoys natural light throughout the day as it has orientation on both sides of the building, street and block lung. The apartment of 173 m2 built, has a social area where we find a kitchen-dining room, living room, terrace, office and a guest bathroom. The day area has an open kitchen with Siemens appliances, dining room and living room. This portion of the property overlooks the heart of the block, being extremely quiet and diaphanous. In turn, the apartment has a quiet balcony from which you can see the Sagrada Familia. The night area consists of three bedrooms, two of them en suite with full bathroom. All of them equipped with large built-in closets. This area is completed with a courtesy bathroom and a hall with a sofa, designed as a reading room. If you are interested in this cohesion between aesthetic trends, do not hesitate to contact us so that we can show you this unique property. The old Esquerra de l’Eixample is, together with La Dreta de L’Eixample, one of the first areas of the city to be urbanized. It is located in the heart of the city, between Avinguda Diagonal, Balmes street, Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes and Comte d’Urgell street. This neighborhood with a long history is home to some of the most important facilities since the beginning of the urbanization of the city, such as the University of Barcelona, the Hospital Clínic and the emblematic Mercat del Ninot. The numerous regal, classical and modernist estates that fill streets like Aribau, Muntaner, the pedestrian Enric Granados among others, are an example of the Eixample designed by Cerdà. You can find apartments that are beautiful modernist jewels of medium or large size and buildings that have been completely renovated. A good part of the life of the neighborhood happens in the island interiors and the premises of first floors that occupy small new and traditional stores, many restaurants, places of leisure and night clubs. As the nerve center of Barcelona, its communication with the rest of the neighborhoods is excellent by public transport, and if you have a car you should know that it is very desirable to locate one of the few parking spaces with the purchase of your home.

Sant Gervasi – Galvany In the northwest of Barcelona we find the district of Sarrià-Sant Gervasi, of which Sant Gervasi-Galvany is one of the six neighborhoods that make it up. Its limits are: Ronda del General Miter, Carrer de Balmes, Via Augusta, Avinguda Diagonal and Carrer Doctor Fleming. In 1866 Josep Castelló Galvany began the urbanization of Camp d'en Galvany. From its beginnings it was a residential and summer neighborhood for the Barcelona bourgeoisie. In the 1950s it grew without ever losing its character as an upper-class neighborhood. The neighborhood does not have major tourist attractions, but it is close to many of them (Tibidabo, Collserola,...). In the neighborhood there are green areas and gardens, such as the Parc del Turó, whose gardens Rubió i Tudurí designed at the beginning of the 20th century, or the Parc de Monterols. The oldest part of the neighborhood is located between Calle Sagués and Calle Amigó, this area near the Parc del Turó is where we find the most select homes. The commercial and business area of the neighborhood is located on Via Augusta, Montaner Street and Avinguda Diagonal. We find buildings following the structure of l'Eixample of closed blocks, although we can also see isolated buildings and houses. The apartments are generally large.

With his urban plan, Cerdà designed an egalitarian city, where some neighborhoods do not differ from others and public services are distributed evenly throughout all corners. The district is the result of one of the most splendid moments in the history of the city, when it was definitively configured as the engine of contemporary Catalonia and broke with the medieval past by tearing down the walls. L'Eixample was built in the years of the industrialization of Catalonia, at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th. The central part, the Dreta de l'Eixample, was the neighborhood of the bourgeoisie who introduced their own style into their home, modernism. We find this property, in a royal estate typical of the area, which occupies an entire floor of an estate from the early 20th century. It consists of 3 double rooms, all with their own bathroom and one of them also has a large dressing room and jacuzzi.

The rear area consists of 2 double bedrooms, both in suite with a full bathroom and an extra courtesy bathroom. The building dates from 1885 and highlights the comprehensive refurbishment to which it was subjected at the beginning of this century where its thermal and acoustic behavior was substantially improved, with the replacement of all its exterior with lacquered aluminum carpentry and double-glazed glass. The interior partitions were doubled, and a layer of acoustic insulation was inserted inside. The building underwent a comprehensive refurbishment to create luxury apartments and offices in the best area of downtown Barcelona. The exterior action consisted of the complete rehabilitation of both facades and their roof, reconstructing all the original details of the building and restoring the original lime stucco that covers both facades. The entrance hall and the communal areas were also restored with marble and high-quality materials and the lift was replaced with a new one in stainless steel and glass. The stringers of the stairs were made of steel with individual support for each marble step. Inside, the aged oak wood flooring stands out, as well as the travertine bathroom cladding. The kitchen is high-end, with low-consumption appliances and built-in white lacquered cabinets. The air conditioning consists of a hidden system of ducted air conditioning for hot and cold air and a system of hot water radiators fed by a gas boiler as heating. The air conditioning drive system is fully integrated into the ceiling cornices, with linear diffusers that go virtually unnoticed. The same happens with the lighting system by means of spotlights flush with the false ceiling with hidden lamps to avoid dazzling.

Of a renowned model urban planning devised by the engineer Ildefons Cerdá, Eixample marks the epicenter of the city from its main streets: The luxurious Passeig de Gràcia, the commercial Rambla de Catalunya and the updated Passeig de Sant Joan, housing the majority of the modernist architectural icons, such as La Sagrada Familia, La Pedrera or La Casa Batlló of the great Antoni Gaudí. It is a large, quiet but exciting  residential area with extremely convenient commercial activity, designed to respect the privacy of the homes. The Catalan modernist architecture so characteristic of stately airs, but with great cosmopolitan touches, extends throughout the neighborhood to the delight of those who wish to live modernism from within, since it is possible to acquire homes within regal estates with valuable original architectural elements, period pieces and even historical and protected. Schools, squares, wadis, parks, stores and restaurants give dynamism to the area that differentiates the Right from the Left, both with wide uniform streets, octagonal islands and wide island interiors that mark the internal distribution of buildings and homes. You will mostly find buildings of strong bricks, floors of generally wide dimensions, medium or high ceilings, with balconies that give to the wide streets or the inner patios of the Cerdá Plan. Keep in mind this living in the Eixample district, if you are looking for a neighborhood where you can have everything within walking distance or very well connected to public transport, both basic and luxury stores, trendy restaurants or even your workplace among the many offices and stores, this could be your neighborhood. If you want to walk among the iconic monuments of the city, with the comfort of equal distance to any other point or neighborhood in the city. Consider Eixample if you are a lover of modernist, stately and typical Catalan architecture and a high street feeling.

The property stands out for its high ceilings, abundant aesthetic details, such as moldings and ceilings, and the Versailles Parquet that can be found in the living room and dining room. This property is located in a regal estate on the corner of the block, enjoying an exceptional distribution, with all its rooms being exterior. It is located in one of the best sections of one of the main streets of Eixample Derecho, standing out also for being located in one of the most demanded areas of Barcelona. Being a principal in an important estate of the most characteristic neighborhood of Catalan modernism, this apartment has all the most characteristic elements of this architectural trend that characterized Barcelona in the early twentieth century; ornamental details in the moldings of the ceilings, high ceilings and large windows with two galleries. The house has three bedrooms, one of them arranged as a suite, with bathroom and dressing room. All are exterior, so that they enjoy abundant natural light throughout the day. There are five balconies and two verandas.

If you are interested in Catalan modernism and want to know the other details that abound in this house, do not hesitate to contact us so we can show it to you in depth. La Dreta de L’Eixample begins in Plaça de Catalunya and its central axis revolves around the Passeig de Gràcia and the Cuadrat d’Or. It is delimited from the busy Calle Balmes to the renovated Passeig de Sant Joan and from the commercial Ronda Sant Pere to the convenient Avinguda Diagonal. It is one of the most expensive and exclusive neighborhoods in Barcelona, along with Pedralbes and Sarrià-Sant Gervasi. It is impossible not to make reference to the luxury of Passeig de Gràcia, with the boutiques of the most exclusive brands in the world, or to the stores on La Rambla de Catalunya. However, the rest of its streets are as or more interesting. In them resided part of the Catalan textile bourgeoisie of the early twentieth century, which has left its mark on the spectacular royal estates and modernist houses designed by the most famous architects of the time, as the Pedrera or Casa Batlló of the great Antoni Gaudí. As a result, the characteristic homes of this neighborhood are spacious apartments with high ceilings, moldings, elaborate flooring and balconies. Many buildings and apartments preserve this original architectural heritage and it is possible to find recently remodeled apartments, penthouses, lofts and even studios, which revive these elements, as well as apartments with a lot of potential to be reformed. This side of L’Eixample is equipped with all kinds of services and stores, as well as educational centers, mainly state-subsidized and private schools.

Modern Barcelona was born in L'Eixample, devised by the engineer and urban planner to whom it owes its magical and unique drawing: Ildefons Cerdà. With his urban plan, Cerdà designed an egalitarian city, where some neighbourhoods are indistinguishable from others and public services are distributed evenly in all corners. The district is the result of one of the most splendid moments in the city's history, when it definitively became the engine of contemporary Catalonia and broke with the mediaeval past by demolishing the walls. L'Eixample was built in the years of the industrialization of Catalonia, at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th. The central part, the Dreta de l'Eixample, was the neighbourhood of the bourgeoisie who introduced their own style, modernism, into their homes. L'Eixample is made up of six neighbourhoods: Dreta de l'Eixample, Antiga Esquerra de l'Eixample, Nova Esquerra de l'Eixample, Fort Pienc, Sagrada Família and Sant Antoni. Its urban plan was based on a large network of perpendicular and crossing streets, all of them uniform, except for two superimposed biassed roads —the Diagonal and the Meridiana— and the Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes. The point where these axes met was the great communications centre of L'Eixample, in which a large square was planned, that of the Glòries Catalanes. With great rigour, he foresaw the uniform distribution of service areas, such as markets, social centres and churches, and large district parks. The apples were not exactly square, since, to facilitate visibility, the angles were cut in the form of chamfers at the corners. Inside each one, construction was only allowed on one or two sides, and the rest of the space was left for the neighbours' garden. The houses were not to be more than three stories high (16 metres), and they were not to be very deep either. Cerdà established it this way because he considered that the health of citizens depended on being able to live in well-lit houses through which the clean air of the gardens circulated, which should completely surround them. Lluís Domènech i Montaner, Josep Puig i Cadafalch, Josep Maria Jujol, Antoni Gaudí and many other architects gradually created the new district. Thus began a new style that moved away from the monotony of eclecticism that had prevailed up to that time: modernism. A style present in buildings of great heritage value that make the centre of the district a unique architectural complex in all of Europe. Modernist architecture mixed the new techniques and materials of the time with the use of resources provided by the various traditional decorative techniques: stucco, sgraffito, leaded glass in stained glass, wrought iron. The work of the craftsmen was put at the service of the design and conception of modernist architects.

This neighborhood of Barcelona was born from the union of two old independent towns: Sarrià and San Gervasio de Cassoles. In the last century, the wealthiest families of Barcelona had palaces and mansions built as their second residence in Sarrià- Sant Gervasi to be able to spend their vacations there and benefit from its tranquility.

It is the most expensive district of Barcelona and it is located on Avinguda Tibidabo, one of the most expensive streets in all of Spain. Today, it is considered the ""chic"" neighborhood of Barcelona. There are private schools, clinics, embassies, many parks and green spaces. It is also a neighborhood that conserves a village aspect, especially in the part of Sarrià, where there are a great number of narrow streets and small squares.

The Eixample Dreta The dreta de l'Eixample is located in the center of Barcelona. In 1850 Idelfons Cerdà devised an urban approach with 150-meter blocks, each with an internal courtyard and wide streets. The Cerdà plan began with the dreta de l'Eixample (Passeig de Gràcia divides the dreta de l'Eixample from l'esquerra de l'Eixample). There are good public transport links with several metro and bus stations. There are FGC or Renfe trains. In Plaza Catalunya you can take the aerobus to go to the airport. Near this neighborhood is the Estació del Nord (one of the three bus stations in Barcelona, with national and international services). Being a central neighborhood you can walk to many places. Orientation is also very easy throughout Eixample due to the grid layout. In the dreta de l'Eixample you can find all kinds of services to cover your needs, there are medical centers and large hospitals nearby (in l'Esquerra de l'Eixample you can find the Hospital Clínic and the Hospital Universitari del Sagrat Cor). There are a large number of schools in the area, especially concerted schools (18) and private schools (16) compared to only 5 public schools. Among others, the School of Music on Mallorca Street (university education) stands out. The area is very commercial, proof of this is El Passeig de Gràcia and Rambla de Catalunya (with international designer shops), there are also many bars, restaurants, supermarkets and shops. The Barcelona Stock Exchange is located in this area. In the dreta de l'Eixample we find the largest concentration of modernist architecture (such as Casa Batlló or Casa Milà among others), art galleries (such as the Fundació Antoni Tàpies) or museums (such as the Museu Egipci). In the most central area we find large shops, offices and luxury homes.

It is home to most of the modernist architectural icons such as La Sagrada Familia, La Pedrera or La Casa Batlló by the brilliant Antoni Gaudí.

The characteristic Catalan modernist architecture with a stately air, but with great cosmopolitan touches, extends throughout the neighbourhood to the delight of those who wish to experience modernism from the inside, as it is possible to acquire homes in regal estates with valuable original, period and even historic architectural elements. Schools, squares, boulevards, parks, shops and restaurants give dynamism to this area that differentiates the Right side from the Left side, both with wide uniform streets, octagonal islands, and wide island interiors that mark the internal distribution of the buildings and houses. You will find mostly strong brick buildings, flats of generally large dimensions, medium to high ceilings, with balconies overlooking the wide streets or the interior courtyards of the Cerdá Plan. Consider this area if you are looking for a neighborhood where you can find everything within walking distance or very well connected by public transport, both basic and luxury shops, trendy restaurants or even your work among the many offices. If you want to walk between the iconic monuments of the city, with the convenience of equidistance to any other point or neighborhood.

As a result, the characteristic homes of this neighborhood are spacious apartments with high ceilings, moldings, elaborate flooring and balconies.

It is impossible not to make reference to the luxury of Passeig de Gràcia, with the boutiques of the most exclusive brands in the world, or to the stores on La Rambla de Catalunya. However, the rest of its streets are as or more interesting. In them resided part of the Catalan textile bourgeoisie of the early twentieth century, which has left its mark on the spectacular royal estates and modernist houses designed by the most famous architects of the time, as the Pedrera or Casa Batlló of the great Antoni Gaudí. As a result, the characteristic homes of this neighborhood are spacious apartments with high ceilings, moldings, elaborate flooring and balconies. Many buildings and apartments preserve this original architectural heritage and it is possible to find recently remodeled apartments, penthouses, lofts and even studios, which revive these elements, as well as apartments with a lot of potential to be reformed. This side of L’Eixample is equipped with all kinds of services and stores, as well as educational centers, mainly state-subsidized and private schools. You will find it very easy to move around on foot or through the public transport connections to the most expensive stores and restaurants in the city.

One of its strong points is its optimal and fluid distribution without corridors that takes advantage of each of its square meters. An unburdened entrance hall of 15.50m2 divides the day and night area, and is the anteroom to a multipurpose space converted into a loft from where you can admire the elegant kitchen with first class finishes. Beautiful custom-designed Verrièrres frame this area leading to the 25m2 living room and the large dining room with seating for 8 people. The master suite can be accessed from the entrance hall or from the day area, connected to a living room that integrates conveniently with the suite or the dining room through imposing sliding doors. Without adding this multipurpose space, the suite adds almost 30m2 including a dressing room with fitted wardrobes and a large bathroom with Neolith finishes. The spacious secondary bedrooms are 21m2 and 15m2 and have en-suite bathrooms and fitted wardrobes. The natural oak parquet floors in herringbone, moldings, Neolith finishes and Smeg appliances demonstrate the quality and care with which this apartment of Art Deco-inspired elegance was created. La Dreta de L’Eixample begins in Plaça de Catalunya and its central axis revolves around the Passeig de Gràcia and the Cuadrat d’Or. It is delimited from the busy Calle Balmes to the renovated Passeig de Sant Joan and from the commercial Ronda Sant Pere to the convenient Avinguda Diagonal. It is one of the most expensive and exclusive neighborhoods in Barcelona, along with Pedralbes and Sarrià-Sant Gervasi. It is impossible not to make reference to the luxury of Passeig de Gràcia, with the boutiques of the most exclusive brands in the world, or to the stores on La Rambla de Catalunya. However, the rest of its streets are as or more interesting. In them resided part of the Catalan textile bourgeoisie of the early twentieth century, which has left its mark on the spectacular royal estates and modernist houses designed by the most famous architects of the time, as the Pedrera or Casa Batlló of the great Antoni Gaudí. As a result, the characteristic homes of this neighborhood are spacious apartments with high ceilings, moldings, elaborate flooring and balconies. Many buildings and apartments preserve this original architectural heritage and it is possible to find recently remodeled apartments, penthouses, lofts and even studios, which revive these elements, as well as apartments with a lot of potential to be reformed. This side of L’Eixample is equipped with all kinds of services and stores, as well as educational centers, mainly state-subsidized and private schools. You will find it very easy to move around on foot or through the public transport connections to the most expensive stores and restaurants in the city. The Eixample Dreta is the best neighborhood if you want to admire and live in the noble zone of the fascinating Catalan modernism, to reside in one of its characteristic regal estates, and to coexist in perfect balance with the vibrant and luxurious commercial life.

It is next to the Urquinaona square and a few minutes’ walk from the Paseo de Gracia and Plaza Catalunya. It has been thoroughly refurbished with high quality materials and finishes, such as the hardwood parquet, the modern design kitchen with NEFF appliances and the materials used in the enclosures. In addition, the apartment has some of the old architectural details, such as the restored stained glass windows that overlook the inner courtyard, the original iron pillars and some of the recovered hydraulic floors.

Of a renowned model urban planning devised by the engineer Ildefons Cerdá, Eixample marks the epicenter of the city from its main streets: The luxurious Passeig de Gràcia, the commercial Rambla de Catalunya and the updated Passeig de Sant Joan, housing the majority of the modernist architectural icons, such as La Sagrada Familia, La Pedrera or La Casa Batlló of the great Antoni Gaudí. It is a large, quiet but exciting  residential area with extremely convenient commercial activity, designed to respect the privacy of the homes. The Catalan modernist architecture so characteristic of stately airs, but with great cosmopolitan touches, extends throughout the neighborhood to the delight of those who wish to live modernism from within, since it is possible to acquire homes within regal estates with valuable original architectural elements, period pieces and even historical and protected. Schools, squares, wadis, parks, stores and restaurants give dynamism to the area that differentiates the Right from the Left, both with wide uniform streets, octagonal islands and wide island interiors that mark the internal distribution of buildings and homes. You will mostly find buildings of strong bricks, floors of generally wide dimensions, medium or high ceilings, with balconies that give to the wide streets or the inner patios of the Cerdá Plan. Keep in mind this living in the Eixample district, if you are looking for a neighborhood where you can have everything within walking distance or very well connected to public transport, both basic and luxury stores, trendy restaurants or even your workplace among the many offices and stores, this could be your neighborhood. If you want to walk among the iconic monuments of the city, with the comfort of equal distance to any other point or neighborhood in the city.

It is distributed on a large surface area, with a typical Eixample distribution that overlooks the street on one side, and on the other, a surprisingly quiet interior courtyard.

Ideal for people who are looking for a large house, or who are looking for a return since the house has a License. There is also the possibility of splitting. The Eixample Dreta The dreta de l'Eixample is located in the center of Barcelona. In 1850 Idelfons Cerdà devised an urban approach with 150-meter blocks, each with an internal courtyard and wide streets. The Cerdà plan began with the dreta de l'Eixample (Passeig de Gràcia divides the dreta de l'Eixample from l'esquerra de l'Eixample). There are good public transport links with several metro and bus stations. There are FGC or Renfe trains. In Plaza Catalunya you can take the aerobus to go to the airport. Near this neighborhood is the Estació del Nord (one of the three bus stations in Barcelona, with national and international services). Being a central neighborhood you can walk to many places. Orientation is also very easy throughout Eixample due to the grid layout. In the dreta de l'Eixample you can find all kinds of services to cover your needs, there are medical centers and large hospitals nearby (in l'Esquerra de l'Eixample you will find the Hospital Clínic and the Hospital Universitari del Sagrat Cor). There are a large number of schools in the area, especially concerted schools (18) and private schools (16) compared to only 5 public schools. Among others, the School of Music on Mallorca Street (university education) stands out. The area is very commercial, proof of this is El Passeig de Gràcia and Rambla de Catalunya (with international designer shops), there are also many bars, restaurants, supermarkets and shops. The Barcelona Stock Exchange is located in this area. In the dreta de l'Eixample we find the largest concentration of modernist architecture (such as Casa Batlló or Casa Milà among others), art galleries (such as the Fundació Antoni Tàpies) or museums (such as the Museu Egipci). In the most central area we find large shops, offices and luxury homes. La Dreta de l’Eixample was at the beginning of the 20th century a bourgeois neighbourhood, many of whom went to live in the upper area, despite this the neighborhood is still a well-to-do, upper-middle class place.

Vila de Gràcia is one of the most charming neighborhoods in Barcelona. Its small streets, short and narrow streets and more and more pedestrians make it ideal for people's lives. Gràcia is very attractive and well-equipped with cultural and educational facilities, healthcare, social services and for the elderly. The surface of the district occupies 1.3 km2, in an irregular urban fabric of small streets and 16 public squares, some emblematic. It remains connected to the rest of the city by public transport. In recent years, it has gained public space and, with the pacification of traffic, has reduced the number of vehicles favoring the use of public transport, bicycles and walking everywhere. Local commerce, restaurants, craft activities, design and illustration, as well as cultural production from experimental to classical music, dance, theater and the performing arts, are the economic engines of the territory. The complete remodeling and the increase in services of the Star, Verdi and Freedom markets has considerably increased its users and visitors, while that of the Abaceria will begin its complete reform soon.
